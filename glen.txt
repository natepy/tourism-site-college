Tipperary's most scenic holiday destination

The Glen of Aherlow, Tipperary's most attractive and scenic holiday destination, 
is a lush valley where the River Aherlow runs between the Galtee Mountains and the
wooded ridge of Slievenamuck. Bounded by the rural villages of Bansha and Galbally,
the Glen was historically an important pass between Limerick and Tipperary.

Today there are opportunities for walking, rambling, horseriding, cycling and fishing. 
The Glen is renowned for the warmth of its welcome and the friendship of its people. 
Nowhere will this be more evident to the visitor than in the local restaurants, pubs, shops and accommodation.

Within the Glen the focal point is the Statue of Christ the King. Erected in 1950,
Christ the King, overlooking the valley at its most scenic viewpoint has his hand 
raised in "blessing the Glen and all who pass by", attracts thousands of visitors every year. 
The entrance to the Glen of Aherlow Nature Park is adjacent to Christ the King.
The Nature Park is a series of loop walking trails, suitable for families, with 
information panels on the flora and fauna of the area, picnic tables, so take a
ramble in a natural woodland at your leisure.
